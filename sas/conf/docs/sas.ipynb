    "\n",
    "SAS Kernel through SASpy allows a python process to connect to SAS 9.4 and run SAS code, generated by the supplied object and methods or explicitly user written, and returns results as text, HTML5 documents (via SAS ODS), or as Pandas Data Frames. It supports running analytics and returning the resulting graphics and result data. It can convert between SAS Data Sets and Pandas Data Frames. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has multiple access methods which allow it to connect to local or remote Linux SAS, IOM SAS on Windows or Linux (Including Grid Manager), and local PC SAS. It can run w/in Jupyter Notebooks, in line mode python or in python batch scripts."
